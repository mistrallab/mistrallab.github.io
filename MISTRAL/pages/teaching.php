<p>
The course is an introduction to structural bioinformatics. Additionally, advanced techniques used in structural bioinformatics will be covered. In the scope of this course, students will learn to analyze, classify, simulate, predict and visualize biological molecules, mainly proteins. We cover the fundamentals of protein structures, structure determination techniques, molecular dynamics simulations, molecular docking and techniques to predict the protein interaction in atomic resolution.

<p>This course provides an in-depth review of the publicly available software tools and biological databases. Different types of biological data will be introduced and techniques for organization of biological data will be discussed. Also, the course will cover extensive use of web- based bioinformatics environments for investigation and analysis of biological data. <br> At the end of this course, the student will</p>
<ul>	
<li>learn basic information on database concepts, relational algebra and entity-relationship diagrams.</li>
<li>learn using SQL to construct a database from scratch and writing queries to retrieve data.</li>
<li>have the skill to find biological information from available database, to process these data and to use available tools to visualize these data.</li>
<li>have the skill to integrate data from multiple sources.</li>
<li>improve writing and presentation skills.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a href="https://catalog.metu.edu.tr/course.php?course_code=9080500" target="_blank">BIN500 - Programming for Informatics </a></b></p>
<p>The course is an introduction to scientific computation and computer programming for graduate students with no prior programming background. Students will learn how to solve scientific problems with programming, how to write a complete program that gets inputs, perform computations and gives outputs by using loops, functions, and different data types. The course covers scientific problems from different areas to be solved with Python programs, which is a popular, general-purpose, open-source language and widely used in several areas of informatics in both industry and research fields.</p>
<p>The course objective is to provide first knowledge and basic skills of programming with Python.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to programming concepts using Python</li>
<li>Understanding the data types and structures.</li>
<li>Writing programs by using Python.</li>
<li>Solving problems with scientific computations in Python.</li>
<li>Debugging programs. </li>
</ul>
